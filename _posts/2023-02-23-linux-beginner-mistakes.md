We're going to cover a mistakes that Linux beginners make when they first move to Linux so you're all happy about making the switch you're willing to discover and learn a whole new world of computing and then you ruin it all by making these mistakes 

## First mistake 
That linux beginners make is trying to apply the concepts that 
they already know to linux itself it's understandable you're coming from an other operating system you know a lot of things you have plenty of experience and you've read a bunch of articles telling you that linux can do anything that windows or mac os can do and while that is true it doesn't mean that linux will do these things in the exact same way as what you're used to for example drivers on linux there is virtually no driver installation apart from the proprietary nvidia drivers either your devices drivers are in the linux kernel and it's supported out of the box or the drivers are not in there and chances are it won't get supported you can compile some third-party drivers for a few very limited set of peripherals but generally 
your drivers are in the kernel you get newer drivers when you update the kernel 
and that's it the file system will be different and the location of files will 
also be different installing applications isn't hunt online for an installer it's a one-click install from a graphical store or package manager you don't need an 
anti-virus unless you're looking to grab files from windows users and passing them on to other windows users

## Second mistake 
Most people make is getting hung up on distributions what 
a distribution is  is basically just a way to package the linux kernel some 
system tools a graphical desktop manager some drivers basically a few packages 
and that's it what users generally think when they see a distro is 
the look they retain the look and feel of this distribution and what they 
really want is something that looks like that not specifically the distro 
itself beginners will tend to install or gravitate towards a specific 
distribution because of the way it looks and feels 
and they tend to forget or not know that you can replicate look and feel on 
virtually any other distribution linux is customizable you can grab the theme 
and the icons and do that exact look somewhere else what users should really 
look for is desktop environments not distributions when you're a beginner you 
need to look at a distro that you like you like the way it looks then you just 
take a look at what desktop environment it uses is it gnome is it kd is it xfc 
is it pantheon cinnamon once you know that you pick a linux beginner-friendly 
distribution like for example kubuntu ubuntu zorino s linux mint and you 
replicate the look and feel of the distro on the right desktop environment 
you don't have to use garuda linux if you want something that looks like 
garuda you can have the same thing on kubuntu with organia with a more stable 
user-friendly base the mistake here is picking a distribution just because 
of the way it looks and ending up with something that is either too complex too easy to screw up
